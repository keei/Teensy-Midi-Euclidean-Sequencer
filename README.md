# Teensy-Midi-Euclidean-Sequencer
A usbMidi euclidean sequencer on a Teensy 3.5 programmed using Arduino IDE

this is a four channel usb MIDI euclidean sequencer. the sequencer is running on a Teensy 3.5. The setup consist of four rgb rotary encoders from Sparkfun, a Teensy, an ssd1306 lcd, four momentary buttons, and four 16led neopixel rings. The housing is an old case from a bottle of port, for now, and a piece of spare translucent perspex.

Euclidean rhythms are explained by White Noises at the link below. there are three parts,
1. the total number of steps in the sequence
2. the number of hits within those steps
3. how far the sequence is offset by

The euclidean algorithm is used to divide up the number of hits across the number of steps as evenly as possible. So, for example, if we had four hits happening over 16 steps, there would be one hit every four steps. Interesting things happen when the number of beats can not be divided evenly over the number of steps, and also when the number of total steps varies between different channels.

absolutely no deep dive menu

The sequencer automatically uses external midi clock if present when switched on, otherwise uses internal clock that can be controlled by one of the rotary encoders.

all active steps per channel are shown as light blue, with the evenly spaced beats / hits shown as red. the rotary controlled selection options match blue for step number selection and red for beat number selection. 

each channel can be switched off or on, change the clock divider, change the step number and beat number, as well as have an offset start point. this is all done by using the push button of the rotary encoder to select the option and then turn the encoder to select the value for that option. Al the settings are show on the LCD screen.

I wanted to try and use software only debounce rather than hardware debounce as used on previous projects with these rotary encoders. It was not easy, and perhaps I should have gone with hardware as there there is still some small amount of gutter that I am trying for sort out. Also, this would have been a perfect project for using a pcb, as its a true rats nest under the hood.
